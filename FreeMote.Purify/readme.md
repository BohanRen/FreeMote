# FreeMote.PurifyA tool lib to *infer* the key of an Emote PSB file. It don't need any other file(e.g. DLL), and can do inference with or without brute force. It can get the key very fast and is universal for most Emote PSB files.# Feature* support Emote PSB v2-v3 (only works with *Emote* PSB, not for normal PSB)* different modes: Fast(All from inference) / Safe(Inference + small range brute) / Brute* Can handle both header & body(string) encryptionIt's almost done but still need some work, and it may not be released since I have Emote projects myself.---by Ulysses, wdwxy12345@gmail.com
